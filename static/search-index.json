Transform Your Business Today Ready to turn challenges into competitive advantages? Let's create solutions that drive real results for your business. Get in Touch Engineering has been my calling since childhood. I displayed technical aptitude early on, methodically disassembling and reassembling toys to understand their mechanisms. I approached play with an engineer's mindset\u2014using Lego simulators as prototype design tools and leveraging games as learning vehicles for concepts ranging from language to spatial navigation. My fascination with computers began during primary school, where I mastered operating system installations and discovered Linux after being inspired by a BBC Click feature on Ubuntu. This sparked a deeper exploration into computing systems and led me to self-teach programming through online resources. My academic journey took me through Pakistan's premier institutions, where I formalized my engineering knowledge. Throughout my career, my technical focus has evolved across web development, embedded systems, and robotics\u2014demonstrating my versatility while maintaining a foundation of engineering excellence. Resilience defines my professional character. Through challenges and setbacks, I've remained steadfast in my commitment to engineering innovation and true to my purpose of creating impactful technological solutions.
