We propose FedGAN, a federated learning framework for synthetic medical image generation that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with cross-silo federated learning. Our approach pretrains a DCGAN on abdominal CT scans and fine-tunes it collaboratively across clinical silos using diabetic retinopathy datasets. By federating the GAN\u2019s discriminator and generator via the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, FedGAN generates high-quality synthetic retinal images while complying with HIPAA and GDPR. Experiments demonstrate that FedGAN achieves a realism score of 0.43 (measured by a centralized discriminator). This work bridges data scarcity and privacy challenges in medical AI, enabling secure collaboration across institutions. Read more Development of a Drone with an integrated sprayer system for Precision Agriculture Journal/Conference: Pending Submission Date: March 2025 Precision agriculture improves crop yields and ensures food security. Precision agriculture is the integration of modern technologies such as drones in the field of agriculture. Drones have various applications in agriculture such as crop mapping, crop health monitoring, and spraying. Commercially available spraying drones are unaffordable for farmers in low- income countries. We developed a low-cost teleoperated drone with an integrated spraying mechanism. A spraying system was developed and integrated with the assembled drone. The drone\u2019s stability, payload capacity, and spraying efficiency were tested. The drone completed several flights while spraying fluid with good stability. Manual spraying method results in pesticide wastage and is harmful to the operator. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spraying drone can enhance efficiency and safe for operator. Read more What My Clients Say \" \"Excellent work from Hassan.

I am actively seeking contract work and open to all kinds of projects. I was born on April 20, 1995, at CMH Multan, but my roots trace back to Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2014a town 45 km from Peshawar. My grandfather, Advocate Bahir Ullah Khan, was a prominent legal figure, a life member of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and the Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Though he resided in the Cantt area, our ancestral home is in Pir Piai . I continue to honor his legacy, and if not for practical considerations, I would have named my daughter Breshan Hassam Kamran Bashir\u2014but I chose to simplify it for convenience. My father, a retired Brigadier General, was an aeronautical engineer with a dynamic career spanning IT companies, power plants, and various impactful roles in the Army. From an early age, I had a strong passion for engineering and taught myself programming, which has been an integral part of my journey ever since. Let's Work Together Get in Touch I have always been ahead of the curve. Long before modern Computer-Aided Design (CAD) became standard, I used LEGO simulations to design my robots before building them in the real world. Privacy Policy Last updated: March 2, 2025 1.
