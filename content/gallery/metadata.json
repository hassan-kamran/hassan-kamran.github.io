    "description": "I reverse-engineered Intellievent's poorly documented API to develop a real-time, asynchronous dashboard for One World Rental, a global company. The dashboard processed and relayed data to multiple teams, providing management with insights into the order preparation lifecycle. It was optimised for large screens, required no user interaction, and achieved a full global update in just 3 seconds. Running on an Azure VM, it delivered high performance at minimal cost.",
