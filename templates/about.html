            <p>
              Born on April 20, 1995, at CMH Multan, my heritage traces to Nowshera,
              Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. My grandfather, Advocate Bahir Ullah Khan, served as 
              the Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a life member of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
              Our ancestral home is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Piai" aria-label="My Village">Pir Piai</a>.

            <h3>Early Passion</h3>
            <p>
              Engineering has been my calling since childhood. I methodically disassembled toys to understand 
              their mechanisms, used Lego simulators as prototype design tools, and discovered Linux after being 
              inspired by a BBC Click feature on Ubuntu.

            <h3>Academic Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              My academic journey through Pakistan's premier institutions formalized my engineering knowledge. 
              My technical focus has evolved across web development, embedded systems, and robotics.
