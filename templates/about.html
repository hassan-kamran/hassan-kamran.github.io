    I am an accomplished engineer based in Islamabad, positioning myself as a
    thought leader in science and technology. Currently available for contract
    work, I welcome challenging projects across various domains.

    Born on April 20, 1995, at CMH Multan, my heritage traces to Nowshera,
    Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—a historic town 45 km from Peshawar. My grandfather,
    Advocate Bahir Ullah Khan, served as a distinguished legal figure, a life
    member of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and the Advocate General of Khyber
    Pakhtunkhwa. While he resided in the Cantt area, our ancestral home is in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Piai" aria-label="My Village"
      >Pir Piai</a
    >. I honor his legacy through my commitment to professional excellence and
    entrepreneurial vision.

    My father, a retired Brigadier General, built a distinguished career as an
    aeronautical engineer, contributing his expertise to IT companies, power
    plants, and various strategic roles within the Army.

    Engineering has been my calling since childhood. I displayed technical
    aptitude early on, methodically disassembling and reassembling toys to
    understand their mechanisms. I approached play with an engineer's
    mindset—using Lego simulators as prototype design tools and leveraging games
    as learning vehicles for concepts ranging from language to spatial
    navigation. My fascination with computers began during primary school, where
    I mastered operating system installations and discovered Linux after being
    inspired by a BBC Click feature on Ubuntu. This sparked a deeper exploration
    into computing systems and led me to self-teach programming through online
    resources.

  <p>
    My academic journey took me through Pakistan's premier institutions, where I
    formalized my engineering knowledge. Throughout my career, my technical
    focus has evolved across web development, embedded systems, and
    robotics—demonstrating my versatility while maintaining a foundation of
    engineering excellence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resilience defines my professional character. Through challenges and
    setbacks, I've remained steadfast in my commitment to engineering innovation
    and true to my purpose of creating impactful technological solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue to build upon the foundations laid by my predecessors, I hope
    future generations will carry forward this legacy of innovation, technical
    excellence, and unwavering determination. My aspiration is that the path I
    forge today will inspire young engineers to push boundaries, solve
    meaningful problems, and uphold the values of intellectual curiosity and
    professional integrity that have guided my journey.
